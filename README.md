# Clayton Connect 2020 Brochure Page

### Install it
``` npm install```

### Update it
The markup for this page is built with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and compiled with [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/). To make changes, update files in `/src` and run `npm run dev` to compile.

If you'd like to minify the css and js, run `npm run production`.

**__Otherwise__** if you just want to make small final changes, you can edit the compiled markup in `/dist`, though this will be overwritten with any subsequent compile.
